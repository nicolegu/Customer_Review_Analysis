# Customer_Review_Analysis

The project aims to analyze reviews of watches. Customer review data is an important information source to understand customer experience. The numerical rating of a product provides an overall feedback, while customer reviews help us to learn the aspects of product or service customers care most.

## Project Structure


## Topic Modeling
By using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), I discover 5 topics among the watch reviews, and I assign each review to a topic according to the document-topic distributions. Most of the topics are related to the look and quality of watches. However, there is one topic deviating from others. The words thet co-occur under the topic include gift, love, wife, and husband, which are not directly linked to watches. This suggests some of the purchases were actually gifts to significant others. Hence, if we can further examine purchase dates, Amazon can target these customers using discounts or advertisements in a specific period of time.
